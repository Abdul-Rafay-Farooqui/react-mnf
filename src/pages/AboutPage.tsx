              <p className="text-lg mb-6">
                MyNeedfully.com was born from a simple observation: when people face crises like natural disasters, domestic violence, or homelessness, they often need specific items to rebuild their lives â€“ but it's hard for friends, family, and community members to know exactly what to provide.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg mb-6">
                We created a platform that makes it easy for individuals in need to create wishlists of essential items, and for others to directly fulfill these needs. By connecting people in crisis with those who want to help, we enable communities to provide targeted, meaningful support.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg mb-6">
                Our vision is a world where no one faces crisis alone, where communities respond effectively to individuals' needs, and where the path to recovery is made smoother through direct, tangible support.
